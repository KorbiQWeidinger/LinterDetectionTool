Welcome to the LinterDetectionTool repository! <br>
My name is Korbinian Quirin Weidinger and I'm a student at the Technical University Munich.


supervision of the lecturer Ricard Pillosu on the 2nd Year Project subject. Today I will introduce you an interesting and useful guide about Static Analysis and I will explain why you should use it when developing any game or application.

When we are developing a program there is a lot of pressure and sometimes the timelines are too heavy, and the developers canâ€™t ensure a good quality on the code, creating more bugs and slowing down de current development. To ensure that this do not happen, exist some amazing tools to make it easier and avoid possible problems in the future.

The LinterDetectionTool was developed to detect linter usage in project repositories.
